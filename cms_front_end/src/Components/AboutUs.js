          <h3 className="subtitle">History</h3>
          <p>
            The Seventh-day Adventist Church traces its roots to the Millerite
            movement of the 19th century, led by William Miller. Miller
            predicted that Jesus Christ would return to Earth in 1844. When this
            event did not occur as expected, a group of Millerites, led by Ellen
            G. White and other pioneers, re-evaluated their beliefs and formed
            what would become the Seventh-day Adventist Church. The denomination
            officially organized in 1863 in Battle Creek, Michigan, United
            States.
